## Overview

Marble Maze is a board game where the player uses gravity and board rotation in order to get a marble to the board finish line as quickly as possible. Our game has a twist in that the finish line will switch from one location to another within a well-defined set of possible finish lines. This game incorporates AI that should be able to improve upon its past performances and to uncover the pattern of possible finish lines in order to capitalise upon such inferred knowledge. 

## The Maze Board

Our board constitutes a moderately complex maze for our AI controlled marble:

## Simple Game Mechanics

The board can be rotated either using the standard WASD keys (i.e. the A and D keys roll the board and the W and S keys adjust the pitch of the board).
